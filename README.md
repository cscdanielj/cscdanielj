# Hello All! üëã Welcome to my Github Profile!!

I‚Äôm Jason Daniel, a recent Cybersecurity graduate with a small foundation in IT support, incident response, and problem-solving. I earned my Bachelor‚Äôs Degree in Cybersecurity from The University of Southern Mississippi and am eager to launch my career as a cybersecurity professional.

## What I‚Äôm focused on
- Collect ‚Üí Detect ‚Üí Investigate in a home SOC
- Writing detections from real logs (Sysmon, Windows Events, Suricata)
- Clear, repeatable documentation others can follow

## Skills snapshot
**Platforms:** Ubuntu Server, Windows 10  
**SOC stack:** Wazuh, Suricata, Elastic/Beats  
**Endpoint:** Sysmon, Winlogbeat  
**Networking:** NAT / Host-only lab networks, packet capture, log shipping  
**Scripting:** Bash, PowerShell (beginner-friendly, task-oriented)

## Featured labs
### 1) Ubuntu SOC Lab (Wazuh + Suricata)
- Deploys Wazuh all-in-one on Ubuntu 20.04.6
- Optional Suricata IDS monitoring the host-only network
- Includes screenshots, configs, and a short incident walkthrough  
**Repo:** `homelab-ubuntu-soc`

### 2) Windows 10 Endpoint Lab (Sysmon + Winlogbeat)
- Hardens Windows 10 VM, installs Sysmon with a curated config
- Ships logs to the SOC, validates with benign test artifacts (EICAR, LOLBAS examples)
- Two sample detections with query logic and alert screenshots  
**Repo:** `homelab-windows10-vm`

## Learning log
I keep short weekly notes in each lab repo:
- What I changed  
- What broke and how I fixed it  
- One measurable result (new alert, better rule, cleaner diagram)
