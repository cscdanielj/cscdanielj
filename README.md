# Hello All! 👋 Welcome to my Github Profile!!

I’m Jason Daniel, a recent Cybersecurity graduate with a small foundation in IT support, incident response, and problem-solving. I earned my Bachelor’s Degree in Cybersecurity from The University of Southern Mississippi and am eager to launch my career as a cybersecurity professional.


## 🗒️ About Me
- I build SOC home labs on Ubuntu and Windows to practice log collection, threat detection, and incident response.  
- I have hands-on experience with Wazuh, Suricata, Sysmon, and Winlogbeat for simulating enterprise blue team environments.  
- I’m motivated to start my cybersecurity career in a SOC role and continue growing into detection engineering and threat hunting.  


## 📘 What I’m focused on
- Collect → Detect → Investigate in a home SOC
- Writing detections from real logs (Sysmon, Windows Events, Suricata)
- Clear, repeatable documentation others can follow

## ⚙️ Technical Skills 
**Platforms:** Ubuntu Server, Windows 10  
**SOC stack:** Wazuh, Suricata, Elastic/Beats  
**Endpoint:** Sysmon, Winlogbeat  
**Networking:** NAT / Host-only lab networks, packet capture, log shipping  
**Scripting:** Bash, PowerShell (beginner-friendly, task-oriented)

## 🚧 Projects and Labs
- [**Project 1: Home SOC Lab Setup**](https://cscdanielj.github.io/projects/home-soc-lab-setup)  
Building and configuring a Security Operations Center (SOC) lab on Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS and Windows 10 for hands-on practice with log collection, network monitoring, threat detection, and incident response.
- [**Project 2: Windows 10 Log Collection & Analysis with Event Viewer + Sysmon (Future Project)**](#)  
Learning to spot suspicious activity in Windows logs by monitoring process creation, network connections, and authentication events.
- [**Project 3: Ubuntu Security Hardening & Log Review (Future Project)**](#)  
Practice strengthening a Linux System against common threats by applying basic hardening techniques, then review authentication logs to detect unauthorized access attempts or brute-force behavior.
- [**Project 4: Network Traffic Capture & Analysis with Wireshark (Future Project)**](#)  
Gain hands-on experience analyzing raw network traffic to identify patterns, distinguish between protocols, and recognize potentially malicious or abnormal activity.
- [**Project 5: Basic Malware Behavior Simulation (Safe) (Future Project)**](#)  
Understand how persistence mechanisms work in both Windows and Linux by simulating scheduled tasks and cron jobs, then detecting and analyzing them in system logs as an analyst would during malware investigations. 
 

## Learning log
I keep short weekly notes in each lab repo:
- What I changed  
- What broke and how I fixed it  
- One measurable result (new alert, better rule, cleaner diagram)
