# Hello All! 👋 Welcome to my Github Profile!!

I’m Jason Daniel, a recent Cybersecurity graduate with a small foundation in IT support, incident response, and problem-solving. I earned my Bachelor’s Degree in Cybersecurity from The University of Southern Mississippi and am eager to launch my career as a cybersecurity professional.


## 🗒️ About Me
- I build SOC home labs on Ubuntu and Windows to practice log collection, threat detection, and incident response.  
- I have hands-on experience with Wazuh, Suricata, Sysmon, and Winlogbeat for simulating enterprise blue team environments.  
- I’m motivated to start my cybersecurity career in a SOC role and continue growing into detection engineering and threat hunting.  


## 📘 What I’m focused on
- Collect → Detect → Investigate in a home SOC
- Writing detections from real logs (Sysmon, Windows Events, Suricata)
- Clear, repeatable documentation others can follow

## ⚙️ Technical Skills 
**Platforms:** Ubuntu Server, Windows 10  
**SOC stack:** Wazuh, Suricata, Elastic/Beats  
**Endpoint:** Sysmon, Winlogbeat  
**Networking:** NAT / Host-only lab networks, packet capture, log shipping  
**Scripting:** Bash, PowerShell (beginner-friendly, task-oriented)

## 🚧 Projects and Labs
- [Ubuntu SOC Lab](https://github.com/cscdanielj/homelab-ubuntu-soc) — Wazuh SIEM + Suricata IDS on Ubuntu 20.04.6  
- [Windows 10 Endpoint Lab](https://github.com/cscdanielj/homelab-windows10-vm) — Sysmon + Winlogbeat log forwarding  

## Learning log
I keep short weekly notes in each lab repo:
- What I changed  
- What broke and how I fixed it  
- One measurable result (new alert, better rule, cleaner diagram)
