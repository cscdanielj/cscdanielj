# Hello All! üëã Welcome to my Github Profile!!

I‚Äôm Jason Daniel, a recent Cybersecurity graduate with a small foundation in IT support, incident response, and problem-solving. I earned my Bachelor‚Äôs Degree in Cybersecurity from The University of Southern Mississippi and am eager to launch my career as a cybersecurity professional.


## üóíÔ∏è About Me
- I build SOC home labs on Ubuntu and Windows to practice log analysis, threat detection, and incident response.  
- I have hands-on lab experience with Sysmon, Event Viewer, UFW, Wireshark, and Suricata, simulating real-world SOC workflows.  
- I‚Äôm motivated to begin my cybersecurity career in a SOC Analyst role, with long-term goals of growing into detection engineering and threat hunting.  


## üìò What I‚Äôm focused on
- Log Analysis ‚Üí Detecting suspicious activity in Windows (Sysmon, Event Viewer) and Linux (auth.log)
- System Hardening ‚Üí Configuring firewalls (UFW) and monitoring authentication attempts
- Network Visibility ‚Üí Capturing and analyzing traffic with Wireshark to identify anomalies
- Persistence Detection ‚Üí Simulating malware techniques with scheduled tasks & cron jobs and investigating system logs
- Documentation ‚Üí Writing clear, repeatable guides for recreating SOC projects

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Skills 
- **Platforms:** Ubuntu Server, Windows 10  
- **SOC stack:** Wazuh, Suricata, Elastic/Beats, Wireshark  
- **Endpoint:** Sysmon, Event Viewer Winlogbeat  
- **Networking:** NAT / Host-only, firewall configuration (UFW), packet capture, log analysis    
- **Scripting:** Bash, PowerShell (task automation, beginner level)

## üöß Projects and Labs
- [**Project 1: Home SOC Lab Setup**](https://cscdanielj.github.io/projects/home-soc-lab-setup)  
Building and configuring a Security Operations Center (SOC) lab on Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS and Windows 10 for hands-on practice with log collection, network monitoring, threat detection, and incident response.
- [**Project 2: Windows 10 Log Collection & Analysis with Event Viewer + Sysmon (Future Project)**](#)  
Learning to spot suspicious activity in Windows logs by monitoring process creation, network connections, and authentication events.
- [**Project 3: Ubuntu Security Hardening & Log Review (Future Project)**](#)  
Practice strengthening a Linux System against common threats by applying basic hardening techniques, then review authentication logs to detect unauthorized access attempts or brute-force behavior.
- [**Project 4: Network Traffic Capture & Analysis with Wireshark (Future Project)**](#)  
Gain hands-on experience analyzing raw network traffic to identify patterns, distinguish between protocols, and recognize potentially malicious or abnormal activity.
- [**Project 5: Basic Malware Behavior Simulation (Safe) (Future Project)**](#)  
Understand how persistence mechanisms work in both Windows and Linux by simulating scheduled tasks and cron jobs, then detecting and analyzing them in system logs as an analyst would during malware investigations. 
 

## üìöLearning log 
- Building practical experience in log analysis, endpoint hardening, and incident response by configuring and simulating a home Security Operations Center (SOC) environment with Windows 10 and Ubuntu virtual machines.
- Developing skills in event log monitoring and detection using tools like Sysmon and Event Viewer to identify suspicious processes, failed logins, and system activity.
- Enhancing expertise in network traffic analysis with Wireshark by capturing, reviewing, and interpreting packet-level data to spot anomalies and understand protocol behavior.
- Strengthening knowledge of persistence and malware investigation techniques by simulating scheduled tasks and cron jobs, then detecting them through system logs on both Linux and Windows.
